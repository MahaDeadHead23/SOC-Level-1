## 🔎 What is a SOC?
A **Security Operations Center (SOC)** is the hub where analysts investigate, monitor, prevent, and respond to cyber threats **24/7**.  
SOC teams protect:
- Intellectual property  
- Personnel data  
- Business systems  
- Brand integrity  

They act as the central collaboration point in defending against cyberattacks.  
The size of a SOC varies based on the organization.

### 🛡️ Preparation & Prevention
- Stay informed about **current threats** (Twitter, Feedly, etc.)  
- Gather threat intelligence (latest threats, actors, and their **TTPs**)  
- Maintain security hygiene:
  - Update firewall signatures  
  - Patch vulnerabilities  
  - Blocklist / Safelist apps, emails, and IPs  
- Build a security roadmap and prepare for worst-case scenarios  

🔗 Example: [CISA Alert on APT40](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa21-200a)

### 👀 Monitoring & Investigation
- Use **SIEM** (Security Information & Event Management) and **EDR** (Endpoint Detection & Response) to track suspicious activity  
- Alerts are prioritized like a fire alarm system:
  - Critical 🔴  
  - High 🟠  
  - Medium 🟡  
  - Low 🟢  

- Junior Analysts **triage alerts**:
  - Explore *how, when, and why* an attack happened  
  - Drill into logs, alerts, and open-source tools  
  - Take quick action to mitigate threats

## 🎯 Role of a Junior SOC Analyst
- Perform **triaging** on alerts  
- Assist in investigations  
- Help ensure threats are contained before escalation
